================

The MakeKit migration is stable enough to swap over from the older
"mkcomp" and "mkpkg" scripts.  This yields a much faster build (up
to 60% faster in testing) and removes dependencies on specific versions
of libtool and autoconf.  

For more information on makekit, please visit http://mkbuild.sourceforge.net/
Thanks to our own Brian Koropoff for spending the time to develop makekit
and solve some very hairy problems for us.

Review the README file for more details on the new build procedure.
