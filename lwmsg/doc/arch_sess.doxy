@page arch_sess Session Management

@section arch_sess_mgr Session Managers

A session manager is an abstract object which is responsible for tracking
the lifetimes of sessions and other stateful connection information such
as handles.  It is generally not necessary for client applications to
implement or even interact with session managers directly.  However, their
behavior does manifest itself in user-visible ways.

Each session manager has a (probablistically) unique, randomly-generated
session manager ID (<tt>smid</tt>) which is 64 bits in length.  This ID is important
in session establishment and lifecycle.

@section arch_sess_assoc Associations

Each association operates under a specific session manager.  Even
if an association does not have a session manager explicitly set,
it will implictly create a private instance as necessary.  Associations
which have the same session manager and endpoint are considered to be part
of the same session, and thus may share state such as handles.
Associations delegate session and handle logic to the session manager:

- Entering into a session with a peer
- Leaving a session with a peer
- Registration of handles
- Deregistration of handles
- Mapping handle IDs to handle pointers and vice versa

@section arch_sess_conn Connections

During the handshake stage of connection setup, each peer queries the
session manager responsible for the connection for its <tt>smid</tt>
and sends it its counterpart.  Each peer then notifies its own session manager
of its entry into a session, passing along the remote session manager ID
(<tt>rsmid</tt>) along with any security token it received.  When the connection
is closed, it notifies the session manager that it is leaving the session.

@section arch_sess_life Session Lifecycle

When a session manager is notified of entry into a session, it first
consults an internal table of active sessions.  If the session is found,
the manager increments a count in the session record indicating the number
of associations currently participating in that session.  Otherwise, it
creates a new session record with said count set to 1.  Upon notification
of the session being left, it decrements this count.

When the count of a session reaches zero, the session is torn down and
freed.  In particular, any active handles remaining in the session are
cleaned up using the cleanup function registered with
#lwmsg_session_register_handle().

During the lifetime of a session, handles may be registered and unregistered
by participating associations.  Handles, unlike sessions, are not reference
counted -- when unregistered by an association, a handle immediately becomes
invalid, and subsequent use by the peer will result in undefined behavior.

While a session remains active, any association in that session may
use any handle regardless of which association created it.

@section arch_sess_sec Security

When a session manager first creates a session record in its table,
it stores a copy of the peer security token given to it by the
association.  When a session is entered, it checks that the
old and new security tokens are compatible.  If they are not,
the session manager rejects entry into the session -- this typically
leads to the connection being aborted.

Because of this security check, the ill effects of <tt>smid</tt>
collisions are mitigated.  There are two scenarios:

- The colliding <tt>smid</tt>s are associated with the same security token, e.g.
they are from two processes running as the same user.  When this occurs,
the presumably unrelated processes will unintentionally enter into the same
session, causing inexplicable handle collisions.  Assuming users don't attempt
collision attacks against themselves, the likelihood of this occuring is a remote
1 in 2<sup>64</sup>.

- The colliding <tt>smid</tt>s are associated with different security tokens, e.g.
they are from two processes running as different users.  In this case,
one of the two will have the connection aborted.  This could potentially
lead to a denial-of-service attack if it were possible to discover the <tt>smid</tt>
that the victim will use.  To mitigate this possibility, clients and servers do not
share session managers between ingoing and outgoing connections or between outgoing
connections to different endpoints.  This prevents an attacker from using the ID
received from a peer to impersonate it.  In addition, the session manager uses the
best entropy sources possible in order to make guessing <tt>smid</tt>s prohibitively
difficult.
