 * @brief Nexus for incoming and outgoing calls
 *
 * An #LWMsgPeer struct acts as a nexus for both incoming and outgoing calls,
 * combining client and server functionality into a single abstraction.  A peer
 * speaks a single protocol (#LWMsgProtocol) and may do any or all of the following
 * simultaneously.
 *
 * - Listen for incoming calls on any number of endpoints: #lwmsg_peer_start_listen()
 * - Connect to a single endpoint on another peer to make outgoing calls: #lwmsg_peer_connect()
 *
 * To use an #LWMsgPeer as a call server:
 *
 * -# Create and set up an #LWMsgProtocol and optionally an #LWMsgContext
      to customize memory management and logging.
 * -# Create a peer with #lwmsg_peer_new().
 * -# Register one or more tables of dispatch functions to handle incoming calls
 *    with #lwmsg_peer_add_dispatch_spec().
 * -# Register one or more listening endpoints with #lwmsg_peer_add_listen_endpoint().
 * -# Start listening for incoming requests with #lwmsg_peer_start_listen().
 *
 * To use an #LWMsgPeer as a call client:
 *
 * -# Create and set up an #LWMsgProtocol and optionally an #LWMsgContext
 *    to customize memory management and logging.
 * -# Create a peer with #lwmsg_peer_new().
 * -# If the protocol makes use of callbacks, register one or more tables of dispatch
 *    functions to handle incoming callbacks with #lwmsg_peer_add_dispatch_spec().
 * -# Register one or more endpoints to connect to with #lwmsg_peer_add_connect_endpoint().
 *    The first one which can be succefully connected to is the one which will be used.
 * -# Connect with #lwmsg_peer_connect().
 * -# Acquire a call handle with #lwmsg_peer_acquire_call() and call with #lwmsg_call_dispatch().
